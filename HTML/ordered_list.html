   <li>Fry them for 5-6 minutes or until they are light golden in colour.</li>
   <li>Take them out and allow them to cool down to normal room temperature. </li>
   <li>Return the fries into the pan and fry them for 2-3 minutes or until crispy and dark golden brown in colour.</li>
   <li>Place fries on paper towel to absorb excess oil, if any. </li>
   <li>Sprinkle salt over the fries. Fries will be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. </li>
