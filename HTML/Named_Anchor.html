  <h2 id="Fort St. George"> Fort St. George </h2>
  <p>
   Fort St George (or historically, White Town[1]) is the first English (later British) fortress in India, founded in 1639[2] at the coastal city of Madras, the modern city of Chennai. The construction of the fort provided the impetus for further settlements and trading activity, in what was originally an uninhabited land.[3] Thus, it is a feasible contention to say that the city evolved around the fortress.[4] 
  The fort currently houses the Tamil Nadu legislative assembly and other official buildings.<br>

 <h2 id="Covelong">Covelong Beach</h2>
 <p>Covelong Beach is actually Kovalam beach that is located on the coast of the Bay of Bengal near a village named Covelong, Chennai, India. The British, unable to pronounce the name "Kovalam", conveniently named it Covelong. This is a fishing village 40 km from Chennai. Kovalam Beach is on the way to Mahabalipuram near the East Coast Road (popularly ECR).
 Kovalam Beach is one of the finest and beautiful beaches by nature. As it is near Chennai and is located on the way to Mahabalipuram, it is visited by thousands of people each day.[1] Mostly the local crowd is higher in the beach.[citation needed]
 Fishing is the main occupation of the people here. Though the beach is famous, it is littered by tourists and the local people alike.[2]
 Along with the beach, the village of Covelong, famous for its fishing activities draws many tourists. 
It is India's first surfing village. There are surfing schools here.[3]<br>

 <h2 id="Marina">Marina Beach</h2>
 <p>Marina Beach is a natural urban beach in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, along the Bay of Bengal.[1] 
The beach runs from near Fort St. George in the north to Foreshore Estate in the south, 
a distance of 6.0 km (3.7 mi),[2] making it the longest natural urban beach in the country.[3][4][5] 
The Marina is primarily sandy, unlike the short, rocky formations that make up the Juhu Beach in Mumbai. 
The average width of the beach is 300 m (980 ft)[6] and the width at the widest stretch is 437 m (1,434 ft). 
Bathing and swimming at the Marina Beach are legally prohibited because of the dangers, as the undercurrent is very turbulent.
 It is one of the most crowded beaches in the country and attracts about 30,000 visitors a day during weekdays[7]
 and 50,000 visitors a day during the weekends and on holidays.[8][9][10]
 During summer months, about 15,000 to 20,000 people visit the beach daily.[11]<br>

<h2 id="San thome">San thome Church</h2>
<p>The word Santhome or San Thome is derived from Saint Thomas. 
The tradition is that he was martyred in A.D.72 at St.Thomas Mount in the city, and was interred in Mylapore.
 Portuguese records speak of "demolishing the pagodas of Meliahpore". 
Later a church was built over his supposed tomb and today is known as the San Thome Basilica. 
The Basilica is one of the four churches that claim to have been built over the tomb of an apostle.
 (Others include St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, Italy; the Church of Saint James the Great in Santiago de Compostela, 
Spain; and the Ghareh Keliseh Monastery of St. Thaddeus in Ghara-Kilise.<br>
